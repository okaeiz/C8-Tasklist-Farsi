C8-Tasklist-Farsi is a custom implementation of a task list application for Camunda 8, with support for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages, specifically Persian (Farsi). It provides a web interface for managing tasks and processes, integrating with Camunda 8's Zeebe engine.

**Disclaimer:** This project is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Camunda. It is an independent, community-driven project designed to work with Camunda 8 components.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

This project is structured as a monorepo containing the following components:

- `taskapp-web`: React frontend for the task application
- `zeebe-backend`: Node.js backend for interfacing with Zeebe
- `processes-server`: Server for managing process definitions
- `tasks-server`: Server for handling tasks
- `keycloak-proxy`: Proxy for Keycloak authentication

## Features ‚ú®

- View and manage tasks
- Start and interact with process instances
- View process definitions
- Right-to-Left (RTL) and Persian (Farsi) language support
- Integration with Camunda 8 (Zeebe)
- Authentication using Keycloak

## Prerequisites üîß

- Node.js (version specified in each package's Dockerfile)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Camunda 8 Platform (==Self-Managed==)
- Keycloak Server (Installed along with a Camunda 8 Self-Managed deployment)

## Setup and Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/okaeiz/C8-Tasklist-Farsi.git
   cd C8-Tasklist-Farsi
   ```

2. Create `.env` files:
   Create a `.env` file in each package directory (`packages/taskapp-web`, `packages/zeebe-backend`, etc.) and populate them with the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` files in each component for required variables.
   <br />
3. Build and start the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build and start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
<br /> 4. Access the application:
Once all services are up and running, you can access the web application at <http://localhost:3000> (or the port specified in your Docker Compose configuration).

## Development üíª

To work on individual packages:
